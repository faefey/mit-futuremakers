# Regularization

## Topics covered in today's module
* L1/L2 Regularization
* Dropout
* Overfitting
* Underfitting

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I compared the regularization effects of reducing model complexity, L1 and L2 regularization, and dropout layers by visualizing the training vs validation loss curves for each and comparing their validation loss curves.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
It was interesting to visualize the effects of different regularization methods using loss curves.
