# Machine Learning

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Machine learning with Scikit-learn
* Decision Trees
* Linear Regression
* Random Forests

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I reviewed the concepts of supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as decision tree, random forest, linear regression, and logistic regression models, and learned about Gini impurity for decision trees. I practiced using Matplotlib to visualize data points, Graphviz to visualize decision trees, and Scikit-Learn to build machine learning models.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
It was interesting to learn about the concept of Gini impurity.

## Additional resources
1. Did you need to use tools like AI tools ChatGPT or Gemini to answer any of the questions or learn any of the concepts in this notebook? If yes, state for which questions or concepts did you require Generative AI tools? 

    I did not use such tools.

2. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, which part of the answers are written by you, and which part of the answers are written by an AI tool? 

    Not applicable.

3. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, after using the AI tool to gain a better understanding of the material in this notebook, summarize your learnings here.

    Not applicable.

4. Did you use any other resources besides AI tools?
