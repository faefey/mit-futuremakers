# Convolution Neural Network

## Topics covered in today's module
* Convolution neural network components
* Visualizing kernels
* Visualizing feature maps
* Pooling
* Dropout
* Batch norm

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I familiarized myself with the different layers of a convolutional neural network and their functions. I learned how to build convolutional neural networks in TensorFlow with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, as well as dropout and batch normalization layers. I visualized the learned filters and the feature maps outputted from each convolutional layer. I was introduced to pooling with padding, dropout, and batch normalization as regularization methods to reduce overfitting.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
It was interesting to learn about the various ways (pooling with padding, dropout, and batch normalization) to reduce overfitting in neural networks.

## Additional resources
