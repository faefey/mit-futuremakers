# Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)

## Topics covered in today's module
* Generative Adversarial Network
* Generator
* Discriminator

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I learned about generative adversarial networks and how they consist of a discriminator and generator. I realized similarities between autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. I was walked through how to properly train the discriminator and generator at the same time, using code.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
It was interesting to learn about how GANs work and be able to implement a discriminator and generator.

## Additional resources
