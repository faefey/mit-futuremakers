# Artificial Neural Networks

## Topics covered in today's module
* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Hyperparameters
* Forward Pass
* Backpropagation
* Computing accuracy

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I went over the various components of a neural network, such as the hyperparameters (learning rate, number of layers and neurons, training epochs) and the parameters (weight matrices, activations). I learned about mitigating the vanishing and exploding gradient problems using Xavier and Kaiming initialization of weights. I studied code that built, trained, and evaluated a neural network, as well as created its activation functions, from scratch without using TensorFlow.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
It was interesting to learn how to initialize weights properly and to see how much slower a manual implementation of a neural network is compared to a neural network using TensorFlow.

## Additional resources
1. Did you need to use tools like AI tools ChatGPT or Gemini to answer any of the questions or learn any of the concepts in this notebook? If  yes, state for which questions or concepts did you require Generative AI tools? 

    I did not use such tools.

2. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, which part of the answers are written by you, and which part of the answers are written by an AI tool? 

    Not applicable.

3. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, after using the AI tool to gain a better understanding of the material in this notebook, summarize your learnings here.

    Not applicable.

4. Did you use any other resources besides AI tools?

    No.
