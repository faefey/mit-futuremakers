# Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Topics covered in today's module
* Linear models in machine learning
* Introduction to TensorFlow
* Dataloaders
* Building a simple Neural Network

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I attempted to apply linear regression to data that is not linearly separable, which naturally did not work. I proceeded to use TensorFlow to build neural networks with various optimizers, loss functions, and performance metrics and experimented with different number of layers and neurons, as well as the ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax activation functions.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
It was interesting to learn how simple TensorFlow makes building, training, and evaluating neural networks.

## Additional resources
1. Did you need to use tools like AI tools ChatGPT or Gemini to answer any of the questions or learn any of the concepts in this notebook? If  yes, state for which questions or concepts did you require Generative AI tools? 

    I did not use such tools.

2. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, which part of the answers are written by you, and which part of the answers are written by an AI tool? 

    Not applicable.

3. If you answered "yes" to Question #1, after using the AI tool to gain a better understanding of the material in this notebook, summarize your learnings here.

    Not applicable.

4. Did you use any other resources besides AI tools?

    No.
