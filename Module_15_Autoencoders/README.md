# Autoencoders

## Topics covered in today's module
* Upsampling 
* Downsampling
* Encoders
* Decoders

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I learned about how an autoencoder is a neural network that consists of two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder first compresses the input into a latent representation vector. The decoder then attempts to reconstruct the original input from the vector.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
It was interesting to learn about how an autoencoder can be used for feature extraction and generative purposes.

## Additional resources
